<p>I’m sure most of you are pretty familiar with climate change in general terms. In this module we’re going to be looking in a little more detail at how the ocean is changing as a result of our emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<div id="reading" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Before we get going talking about a changing ocean, I’d like you to take the following quiz. It’s not a test and isn’t graded - it’s something I’ve been giving to students and colleagues for a while now to see how well do at some basic climate change facts.</p>
<p>I think it also serves as a good “reading” for this level. Take the quiz, review the answers and how other people who’ve taken this quiz did, and then fill out the exit ticket to record completion of this level. You don’t need to retake the quiz or score a certain number to move on - my goal here is for you to be reacquainted with some of the basic knowns about our changing climate.</p>
