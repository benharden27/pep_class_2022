In the [level 3 discussions](../level-3/) you argued for a particular topic to be the recipient of the prestigious Harden prize. You also heard form your peers and found synergies between your topics.

Your task now is to create a one-page proposal for the work you are going to undertake to make an impact on how well we understand the process. You should think about the following:

* What is not well known? What do you want to know?
* What do you want to find out? 
* What do you need to measure?
* Where do you want to measure it?
* What other resources will you need?
* What difficulties do you envision in executing your plan?
