<p>In the <a href="../level-3/">level 3 discussions</a> you argued for a particular topic to be the recipient of the prestigious Harden prize. You also heard form your peers and found synergies between your topics.</p>
<p>Your task now is to create a one-page proposal for the work you are going to undertake to make an impact on how well we understand the process. You should think about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is not well known? What do you want to know?</li>
<li>What do you want to find out?</li>
<li>What do you need to measure?</li>
<li>Where do you want to measure it?</li>
<li>What other resources will you need?</li>
<li>What difficulties do you envision in executing your plan?</li>
</ul>
