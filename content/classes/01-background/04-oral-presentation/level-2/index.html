<p>Now that we’ve re-familiarized ourselves with some basic facts about climate change, we’re going to take a deeper dive into the impact on the ocean. In this level, you will work in a small group to prepare a factsheet on a particular aspect of our changing oceans.</p>
<p><strong>Please check Slack/Google Classroom for your group assignments and work together with your team through this level. You will only need to submit one document per group</strong></p>
<div id="exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>You will be assigned one of the following topic to research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ocean heat waves</li>
<li>Expanding Oxygen Minimum Zones</li>
<li>Thermohaline slowdown</li>
<li>Ocean Acidification</li>
<li>Coral Bleeching</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to produce a one-page fact sheet on your topic that will include information on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic information on what the process is</li>
<li>How is it being driven (or predicted to be driven) by a changing climate?</li>
<li>What observations do we already have of this process in action (past or present)?</li>
<li>How well do scientists understand the processes? What is still unknown?</li>
<li>What impacts will this process have (or is already having) on ecosystems and humans?</li>
</ul>
<p>You fact-sheet can include images and you should cite your sources at the bottom. Creditable websites are fine sources for this exercise.</p>
<p>We are going to gather all of these fact sheets together by the end of the day <strong>Tuesday June 8</strong>. After your instructors check them for accuracy they will then be made available to all students to review. Our <a href="/discussions/">small-group discussions</a> on June 10 will be on these fact sheets. Details for this discussion will be posted in Level 3.</p>
<p>Please submit one fact sheet per group at the assignment link below. All group members should then fill out an Exit Ticket.</p>
