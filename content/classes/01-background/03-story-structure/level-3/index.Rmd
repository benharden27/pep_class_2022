We're going to go back to look at cross sections through the North Atlantic as we did in [Level 3 of Temperature, Salinity and Density](../../01-physical-oceanography/level-3/). Please review the content in that level if you need any reminders about thermohaline circulation and how to interpret an ocean cross section.

## Reading
To prepare for the following exercise, review the content in Levels [1](../level-1/) and [2](../level-2/).

## Exercise

The following images are cross-sections of oxygen (top) and carbon dioxide (bottom) north-south through the Atlantic Ocean. As [before](../../01-physical-oceanography/level-3/), The left of the cross section is the **south** end of the map showing where the section came from. Like with many observational data sets, the carbon dioxide data is incomplete and only covers the southern end of the Atlantic basin.

For the Oxygen image (top) the yellow colors are lower concentrations of oxygen and the purple colors are higher concentrations.

For the carbon dioxide image (bottom), the blue colors are lower concentrations of carbon and the yellow are higher concentrations.

Think about the following questions to discuss in class:

1. How do the surface values fit with your expectations for how gases dissolve in the ocean?

2. What are the major features below the surface? Which can you explain? Which can't you?

3. How do the features you see relate to the global thermohaline circulation?

4. How might you hypothesize the carbon dioxide graph would look to the north of the equator?
