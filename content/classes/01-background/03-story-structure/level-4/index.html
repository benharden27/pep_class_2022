<p>The oceanic carbon pumps are not quite as simple as we’ve been discussing so far. Along with the standard biological pump where detritus falls to the depths by gravity, there are a few nuanced additions to the way the ocean moves carbon from the surface to the deep ocean.</p>
<p>This is nicely summarized in the following article:</p>
<p><a href="s41586-019-1098-2.pdf">Multi-faceted particle pumps drive carbon sequestration in the ocean</a> by Philip W. Boyd, Hervé Claustre, Marina Levy, David A. Siegel &amp; Thomas Weber</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Read the paper above and write a one-page summary that seeks to answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What tools have scientists traditionally used to measure the biological pump?</li>
<li>What additional pumps exist in the ocean?</li>
<li>How important a role might they play in the overall amount of carbon that reaches the deep ocean?</li>
</ul>
