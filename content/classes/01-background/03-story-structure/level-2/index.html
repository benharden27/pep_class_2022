<p>As with all the ocean properties weâ€™ve discussed so far (temperature, salinity, density, phytoplankton, nutrients), Carbon and Oxygen are also found in different amounts at different depths.</p>
<div id="reading" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Read <a href="ocean-carbon-pump_ScientificItems_BD-2.pdf">The Ocean: A Carbon Pump</a> which talks about the various ways in which carbon dioxide gets from the surface to the deep ocean including through the photosynthesis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch this short video about the Biological Pump</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>The following are idealized profiles of Carbon, Oxygen and Nutrients from somewhere in the ocean.</p>
<p><img src="OceanSolutes18IV.png" /></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Describe the vertical distribution in the three properties
<ul>
<li>Where do the values go up and down?</li>
<li>Where are they minimum and maximum?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How would you explain these patterns in relation to the Oceanic Pumps?</li>
</ol>
<p>Recall the discussion we had about the thermohaline circulation in <a href="../../01-physical-oceanography/level-3/">Level 3 of Temperature, Salinity and Density</a>.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why does oxygen not deplete all the way to zero in the deep ocean?</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit your responses to the Google Classroom assignment below. Wait for a response before moving on to <a href="../level-3/">level 3</a>.</p>
