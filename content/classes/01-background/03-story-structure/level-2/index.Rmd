As with all the ocean properties we've discussed so far (temperature, salinity, density, phytoplankton, nutrients), Carbon and Oxygen are also found in different amounts at different depths.

## Reading

Read [The Ocean: A Carbon Pump](ocean-carbon-pump_ScientificItems_BD-2.pdf) which talks about the various ways in which carbon dioxide gets from the surface to the deep ocean including through the photosynthesis of [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton).

- Watch this short video about the Biological Pump

## Exercise

The following are idealized profiles of Carbon, Oxygen and Nutrients from somewhere in the ocean.

![](OceanSolutes18IV.png)

1. Describe the vertical distribution in the three properties 
    + Where do the values go up and down?
    + Where are they minimum and maximum?

2. How would you explain these patterns in relation to the Oceanic Pumps?

Recall the discussion we had about the thermohaline circulation in [Level 3 of Temperature, Salinity and Density](../../01-physical-oceanography/level-3/).

3. Why does oxygen not deplete all the way to zero in the deep ocean?

Submit your responses to the Google Classroom assignment below. Wait for a response before moving on to [level 3](../level-3/).
